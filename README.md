# Notation_Converter_in_Scheme
This project was my 2nd Homework for the course CMPE 260 (Principles of Programming Languages) at Bogazici University. It was my first project on functional programming paradigm.
## About the Project
This project was about completing functions that parse and translate a statement given in a designated language, to a statement in prefix notation and evaluate it. The context free grammer of the designated language and some other details about the project can be found in the description file. This was my first project on a functional programming language, but after learning the fundamentals of the Scheme, (and have some patience about the parantheseses :) ) I implemented all the functions.
## To Run the Code
One should install DrRacket to execute the given code, namely 'main.rkt'. Then, the execution is straightforward.

Note: Unfortunately, the random sentence generator stated in the description, namely 'generate_sentence.py', is not available in the repository. But one can create sentences by hand using the given grammar, or use the example sentences in the description file to test the code.
